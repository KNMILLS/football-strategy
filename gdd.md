  'Four Verts',
  'Cover 4',
  'Air Raid',
  10000

# Run complete balance analysis
node scripts/playtest-balance.mjs

# Generate detailed report
node scripts/playtest-balance.mjs --format json --output balance-report.json

# CI integration with exit codes
npm run balance-check  # 0=good, 1=warnings, 2=critical
```
