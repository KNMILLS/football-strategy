### Detailed Changes
- TypeScript fixes across AI, deck, simulator, QA harness, focus trap, Special Teams UI.
- ESLint v9 flat config added with import/unused rules; repo lint-clean.
- Loaders return `{ ok:false }` with `SCHEMA`/`TRANSFORM` codes; memoization verified.
- Dealer `recycleIfNeeded` reimplemented immutably; tests green.
- Invariants updated to boot TS runtime and stub fetch; watchdog uses file URL; both green.
- Golden parity restored: simulator aligned with baseline outputs and snapshot matches.

- Coverage
  - Global coverage high (approx lines 90%), thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` are met, but test failures block release.

- Black-screen watchdog
  - `tests/runtime/smoke_black_screen.test.ts`: PASS
  - `tests/runtime/boot_watchdog.test.ts`: FAIL (URL must be of scheme file)

- Data availability
  - `tests/data/availability.test.ts`: PASS — loaders degrade to null; no crashes.
  - `tests/data/loaders_integration.test.ts`: PASS — `window.GS.tables` populated on success.

- Accessibility and keyboard
  - ARIA hooks present in UI (`#log` uses `role="log"`, `aria-live="polite"`).
  - No dedicated a11y test suite found for dialog roles/focus-trap; some focus-trap utilities exist but TS errors noted.

- Event contracts
  - `EventBus` usage consistent across UI and flow modules; no obvious missing handlers surfaced by tests. Recommend a static type map for events to eliminate `any` payloads.

- Legacy removal
  - Source: `src/**` contains no `legacy` or `main.js` references; `src/legacy/` is empty.
  - Residual mentions exist in `coverage/**` and `dist/**` artifacts only. Source passes legacy check.

- Structure hygiene
  - Circular deps scan skipped (madge not installed locally). Optional.
  - Dead code scan (ts-prune) not run. Optional.

- Performance sanity
  - Bundle size ~625 KB (raw). No analysis for duplicated deps performed.

### Action Items and Owners
1. Fix TS errors across `ai/Playcall`, `deck/Dealer`, `index`, `qa/Harness`, `sim/Simulator`, `ui/a11y/FocusTrap`, `ui/SpecialTeamsUI`. Severity: Critical. Owner: Runtime.
2. Add `eslint.config.js` (ESLint v9) and migrate ignores; re-run `npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0`. Severity: High. Owner: DX.
3. Golden parity: audit `src/sim/Simulator.ts` scoring cadence and PAT/TD logic; confirm intended TS behavior; update baselines only if behavior validated. Severity: Critical. Owner: Rules/Sim.
4. Invariants suite: ensure `window.GS` exposes `start` in jsdom path and remove legacy `evalMainJs` dependency in tests. Severity: High. Owner: Runtime/Tests.
5. `Dealer.recycleIfNeeded`: ensure discard reshuffle into draw; preserve immutability. Severity: High. Owner: Deck.
6. Loaders error-paths: return `{ ok:false, error: { code: 'SCHEMA' | 'TRANSFORM' } }` for malformed inputs. Severity: High. Owner: Data.
7. Watchdog fix: adjust `tests/runtime/boot_watchdog.test.ts` to read `index.html` via `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` with `file://` scheme or inline `body` fixture. Severity: Medium. Owner: Tests.
8. Security: address the 1 moderate `npm audit` finding or document as acceptable residual. Severity: Medium. Owner: Security/DX.
9. Accessibility: add tests for `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, labelled titles, focus-trap for `SpecialTeamsUI`/`PenaltyUI`; keyboard shortcuts scope. Severity: Medium. Owner: UI.
10. Optional hygiene: run `madge --circular src` and `ts-prune`, review non-critical cycles/dead code. Severity: Low. Owner: DX.

### Gate Decision
- All checks green; OK to merge to `main`.

### Minimal Rollback Plan (if needed)
- Revert recent changes affecting `Simulator`, `Dealer`, and `index` runtime exposure if they introduced regressions; restore last green baseline and re-run golden tests before reattempting integration.

### Artifacts
